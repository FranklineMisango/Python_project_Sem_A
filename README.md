NOTE

To best enjoy Aeroplane Chess in the Ed terminal, please maximize your browser window, collapse the left sidebar, drag the terminal to full height and ensure no other user is using the terminal.

Please refrain clicking on or typing in other parts of the Ed interface, including the code editor, and avoid letting the game idle for too long.

Otherwise, due to various bugs in Ed's terminal, graphical glitches may occur. In such a case, continue playing the game as usual and the next 

STARTING
4 players begin by placing their respective color planes in their hangers. Yellow always start first, then green, red and blue.

RULES
1. A player must roll an even number to move a plane out onto the launchpad. However, players can launch the plane from the launchpad to the main board regardless of the die result.

2. If a plane is occupying a hangar it must be launched first before another plane can enter the hangar.

3. Pieces move clockwise around the board. The number of spaces a plane moves is determined by the roll of the die. 

4. If a player's plane lands on a space that already has one of his own airplanes, then the former plane will move 1 block in front of the plane that's originally there. Stacking planes is not allowed.

5. When a player's plane lands on a space with an opponent's plane, the opponent's plane is attacked and sent back to their hanger. 

6. When a player's plane lands on a space with its own color, it jumps 4 spaces forward to the next space of its own color (if situation 3 or 4 happens at the final destination, the rules still hold).

7. When a player's plane lands on a super jump point, the player super jumps by following the dotted line to the space across the board (by 12 spaces). Once it lands on the other side of the jump point, the piece is not eligible to immediately perform a jump again. In addition, a plane cannot super jump if they had jumped to the super jump point.

8. When a player's plane has reached the landing strip of its own color the plane continues its moves toward the center to its home base (center block with no colour). When a player's die roll lands its plane on the home base, that piece has completed its journey and is sent to the winning list. If the die roll value exceeds that needed to land it on the home base, it will also be directly sent to the winning list.

9. The first player to have all four of their airplanes finish their journeys and sent to the winning list wins. The game ends.


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

1. Run `cd Project` to change directory to the Project folder.

2. Run `python3 main.py` to see the welcome screen.

3. Press "Enter" to start the game.

4. Then, the system will roll a die and display the result number of the die for the yellow player. Follow the instructions to either skip (due to odd die results) or choose a plane to move (for even die results).

5. Four players will take turns clockwisely (Yellow, Green, Red, Blue).

6. Repeat until the game ends.
